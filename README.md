# Vcancies parser for [career.habr.com] (career.habr.com/vacancies](https://career.habr.com/vacancies?type=all)
This is a parser for the job search site career.habr, implemented as part of an internship assignment. It collects information about job offers in the 'Аналитика данных' and 'Data Science' categories for each level of specialist skills ('Intern', 'Junior', 'Middle', 'Senior', 'Lead'). The 'No Level' class has been added for vacancies where there is no information on the required skill level because it is not applicable to the vacancy or simply not specified by the employer (no skill level information). The data on the number of vacancies is presented in a table.

The results were also visualized via histogram to show the vacancy ratio for all levels.

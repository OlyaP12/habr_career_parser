# Vcancies parser for career.habr.com
This is a parser for the job search site career.habr, implemented as part of an internship assignment. It collects information about job offers in the 'Аналитика данных' and 'Data Science' categories for each level of specialist skills ('Intern', 'Junior', 'Middle', 'Senior', 'Lead'). The tag "No Level" means that the required level has not been labeled on the job card.

The results were also visualized to show the ratio of job vacancies for all levels.
